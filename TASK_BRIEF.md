# Node Backend Technical Challenge

You've been tasked with building a "cards" service for the front-end of an imaginary Greetings Cards website. This exercise requires building a simple REST-like API with two endpoints - one for returning a list of cards and another that returns a single instance of a card.

Please spend no more than 4 (four) hours on this tech test 

We have provided three JSON files that serve as source data - you can find them in ./src/data:
- cards.json
- sizes.json
- templates.json

You can treat these as your data source.

## Endpoints

### GET `/cards`

This endpoint returns a list of cards.
- `imageUrl` should be the image found on the template that corresponds to the first page for the card.
- `card_id` should be the ID of the card`

Expected JSON response:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "card 1 title",
    "imageUrl": "/front-cover-portrait-1.jpg",
    "card_id": "card001"
  },
  {
    "title": "card 2 title",
    "imageUrl": "/front-cover-portrait-2.jpg",
    "card_id": "card002"
  },
  {
    "title": "card 3 title",
    "imageUrl": "/front-cover-landscape.jpg",
    "card_id": "card003"
  }
]
```

### GET `/cards/:cardId`

This endpoint returns a single card identified by its `id`. 

```json
{
  "title": "card 3 title",
  "imageUrl": "/front-cover-landscape.jpg",
  "card_id": "card003",
  "base_price": 200,
  "availableSizes": [
    {
      "id": "sm",
      "title": "Small"
    },
    {
      "id": "md",
      "title": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "id": "gt",
      "title": "Giant"
    }
  ],
  "pages": [
      {
        "title": "Front Cover",
        "templateId": "template001"
      },
      {
        "title": "Inside Left",
        "templateId": "template002"
      },
      {
        "title": "Inside Right",
        "templateId": "template003"
      },
      {
        "title": "Back Cover",
        "templateId": "template004"
      }
    ]
}
```

Expected JSON response: 

### POST `/cards`

This end point should allow a user to add a card to the list of overall cards. The ID of the card should follow the same format as the existing ones. 

Expected JSON request: 

```json
{
    "title": "example title",
    "sizes": [
      "sm",
      "md",
      "gt"
    ],
    "basePrice": 200,
    "pages": [
      {
        "title": "Front Cover",
        "templateId": "template001"
      },
      {
        "title": "Inside Left",
        "templateId": "template002"
      },
      {
        "title": "Inside Right",
        "templateId": "template003"
      },
      {
        "title": "Back Cover",
        "templateId": "template004"
      }
    ]
  }
```

An example response should return the card as if requested by its ID, see the previous endpoint.  

### DELETE `/cards/:cardId`

Expected response would be a confirmation the deletion has happened, either via status code alone or using code and message. 

## Tools, Libraries and frameworks

An app skeleton is provided for your convenience. It consists of the following tools:

- Express
- Jest for unit/integration testing
- Supertest for integration tests
- TypeScript - If you're not familiar with TypeScript you can use JavaScript instead.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|--|--|
| `yarn dev` | run the server in development (watch) mode on port 7000 |
| `yarn test` |  run tests using Jest watch mode |


## Assessment

We will assess the task based on the following criteria:

- How clean, modular and extensible the code is
- Considerations for performance
- Approach to testing
- Knowledge of Node and its APIs
- Use of Git

## Notes

We have provided a notes file `NOTES.md` for any notes that you wish to add that could help your application such as explaining why you've made certain decisions.

Please note we appreciate that your free time is important and feel that doing less "well" is preferable to doing more "less well".  With this in mind if you feel that your code is unfinished please leave some notes explaining what you'd do given more time.  We'll be more than happy to review this.

When it comes to submission please follow the instructions provided in the email you were sent. Please ensure you send us the link to your repo, and add vernonm-emac and antariess as collaborators.

Good luck!
